With love to my beautiful daughter.

# Doll house

Some time ago I started building a dollhouse for my daughter. Part of it was manually constructed, part of it is created using a CNC machine.

For the CNC machine, I use a simple [CNC3018 Pro machine](https://www.wish.com/product/3-axis-desktop-diy-3018-pro-cnc-router-grbl-control-wood-pcb-pvc-cutting-engraving-milling-machine-mini-engraver-laser-machine-5d537ba483889703ffb79b40?&hide_login_modal=true&share=web). 
Software involved is [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) 
(which is free for non-commercial use) and [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle). Tools like CNC4js will also do the trick.

The NC files are generated by Autodesk, and then manually pre-processed.

Feel free to use this for any non-commercial use. Do note that the toolpaths have very little margin for error, and can be quite big. 
Milling a toilet can easily take hours.

As I create more models, I'll share them below.
