# Sink

This is a model of a sink. There are two parts of it: the sink itself and the top place.

I first milled the sink, and then the top plate. The two are designed in such a way, that you can perfectly glue the sink in the cavity that will be milled on the top plate.

Next, I use liquid wood to make the surface a bit smoother and to hide the wood structure a bit. You can make a hole in the bottom of the sink with a small drill. Metal paint and you're done with your sink.
