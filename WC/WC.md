# Toilet

This folder contains a tiny toilet which can be milled. The toilet is milled in 6 passes. First, the left and right side of the toilet 
are milled and glued together. If you feel adventurous, you can then mill out the inner part of the toilet. Next, you can make the back 
and the seat. 

I usually then use liquid wood with some water to make the model more smooth before painting it. Next, paint it, glue it together and 
you're done.

## Hinges

I used a few nails and some can metal for this. Cut the can metal, wrap it around the nails (leave some room for them to move), glue or 
solder the fixed parts, and glue the moving parts to the seat and the toilet.
