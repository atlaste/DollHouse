# Chair

I really like modern chairs. For this chair I used a curved surface, which should be milled from wood. The trick I'm using is that I'm milling at an angle, so that you can do the top first and then the bottom. There are 4 helper structures that keep the piece of wood in place.

At the bottom there are 4 wooden pins. The toolpaths are created in such a way that (0,0) is the bottom of the stick you're going to mill. That means that it will be perfectly cut in the right size, and the cavities will be at exactly the right place. The rest is just a matter of filing off the remainder. Note that all the sticks have a different toolpath; this ensures that you should be able to put in the fourth stick without any issues. 

To be fair, it might be much easier to create the chair using a 3D printer, but what's the fun of that...
